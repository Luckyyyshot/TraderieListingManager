# Traderie Listing Manager Firefox Plugin

A plugin primarily made to learn how to make firefox plugins, but also to automate certain things I do on the website https://traderie.com.

## Installation

1. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
2. Click "This Firefox" on the left sidebar
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. Navigate to the extension directory and select the `manifest.json` file

## Structure
